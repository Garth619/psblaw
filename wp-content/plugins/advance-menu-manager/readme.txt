= Usage =

1) A Custom-built User Interface:
	With hundreds of pages in your menu, you need a tailored UI that offers a complete view of  menu, the parent pages and their child (sub-items). AMM has that user-interface. Besides offering a complete picture of your menu, the clutter-free UI also allows you to view, add, edit and manage your pages and posts to make your job easier. 
	
2) Add pages/posts parallely:
	Besides allowing you to get a comprehensive view of your menu and its sub items, the plugin helps you add menu items and sub-items parallely. This apart, the plugin also helps the user to create and add new pages/posts without going back and forth as is the case with the default WP menu feature.
	
3) Make no mistake while searching files:
	The default search option in WordPress Menu does not offer a detailed look. This increases the chances of selecting a wrong page, leading to task repetition. AMM offers complete view of pages you have searched ensuring you select the right page.
	
4) See Menu Item ID:
	The default WordPress Menu does not provide a quick look into whether a particular menu item is a page or a post. Besides, you also cannot know what the item id is. The AMM id equipped with this functionality to show you complete details in a single user interface to save your time and efforts.

5) Hide existing menu:
	The plugin also offers you a functionality to hide existing menu items when you want to add pages/posts to your current menu. This helps you save time and avoid confusion.
	
6) Manage attributes for a menu item:
	Manage a particular menu item snavigation label, title attribute, CSS classes, Link relationship and description from here.
	

7) Other features you will love:

	-> Manage and delete pages from a single interface, no going to open menu detail content.
	-> Add tags to pages/posts and category
	-> Insert custom links as per your needs
	-> Add a menu item as a child category without going back and forth.
