		<h4>The History of Our Firm</h4>

		<p>In 2005, three lawyers with extensive track records of litigation against negligent corporate giants formed Panish Shea & Boyle LLP. </p>

		<p>Partners Brian Panish, Adam Shea and Kevin Boyle vowed to fight corporate greed and protect consumers from corporations that strive for profits over the safety of their customers. The three founding partners worked together previously and found their shared advocacy for the consumer a driving force behind founding a new firm dedicated to working for you. Since then, Panish Shea & Boyle LLP has added Partner Rahul Ravipudi, an attorney with a similar focus on providing consumers with class action recourse against large corporations engaging in unfair practices.</p>
