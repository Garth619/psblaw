Wordpress Theme built for scalability 

## Getting Started - Setup a Local Wordpress Site

To get started, start by forking this repo and setting up a Wordpress install locally. This repo includes:

- `.htaccess` - includes gzip settings that help improve page speed
- `pq3starter.sql.zip` - starter database (import db into your local settings, changing the `siteurl` and `home` url under `wp_options` to reflect your local environment)
- `wp_content` - includes all assets you will need (plugins, theme, etc)

## Theme Documentation

To begin working on the theme go to the [theme folder](wp-content/themes/pq3/readme.md)
